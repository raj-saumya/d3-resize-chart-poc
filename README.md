# Title

POC for improved expand collapse D3 chart (Performance wise).

# Functionality

Click on bars to view their children.Each clicked parent section is highlighted.
Each bar has its own state, so clicking other bar won't collapse the previous clicked bar.The axis labels also stretch for the occupied respective space.
Currently the chart is only vertically scrollable, but can be extended for horizontal scroll also.
